Integrated Analysis of Gene/Protein Lists

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/MaayanLab/Lists2Networks.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#MaayanLab/Lists2Networks)

A web-based system that allows users to upload and analyze lists of mammalian gene-sets in a client-server software application. Within their workspace users can examine the overlap among the lists they upload, manipulate lists with different set operations, expand lists using existing mammalian networks of protein-protein, co-expression correlations, or background knowledge annotation correlations, and apply simple gene-set enrichment analyses on many gene lists at once against a plethora of prior knowledge datasets.
